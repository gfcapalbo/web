* Extends formview field widget to be readonly, and adds a button to edit them with the web_translate_dialog interface.
  The fields that will have this modification will be only the ones with a translation.enforced.field record.

* Removes translation warning to remind to update other translations now that web_translate_dialog is enforced

Usage
=====

All fields that are translatable will appear as readonly in edit mode.
User must edit them using the translation icon , therefore enforcing the usage of the the
web_translate_dialog dialog.

the usecase is for organizations with mujltiple languages, where multiple users are translating, and forget to update the other languages when performing a change (ignoring the popup odoo provides after save)
